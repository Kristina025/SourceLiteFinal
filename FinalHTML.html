    <h4> If you're visiting this page, you're
        likely here because you're searching for a random 
        sentence. Sometimes a random word just isn't enough,
         and that is where the random sentence generator comes into play.
          By inputting the desired number, you can make a list of as many 
          random sentences as you want or need. Producing random sentences 
          can be helpful in a number of different ways. </h4>
